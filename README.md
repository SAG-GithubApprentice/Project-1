## Project Description
The goal of the project is to forecast the S&P500 stock index.

## Project Overview
We will attempt to predict the trajectory of the SP500 by one year, by running a series of regression and forecast models. We will also extract data from other key economic and financial source like the spot price of gold, and the price of crude oil in order to find correlations and integrate said data with the SP500 data in order to better predict the SP500 forecast.
